Hand Written Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network


## Overview

This is the code for a model that recognizes handwritten digit images (MNIST).  Developed using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the super simple [Keras](http://keras.io/) Library. Wrapped into a Webapp using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) Micro Framework.

## Dependencies

```sudo pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run this to see it in your browser. 

```python app.py```

That's it! It's serving a saved Keras model to you via Flask.
